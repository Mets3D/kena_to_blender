Workflow:
    MORPHS
    - Export characters that have morphs using umodel_kena_morphs_export.exe. There is a very small number of them, so doing this one by one is feasible.
    - I wrote import_morphs.py to import them overnight. The .psk importer seems extremely slow, and it took a total of 13 hours.
    CORRECT SKELETONS
    - At least Kena, and potentially other characters, export with wrong skeleton using the morphs build.
    - So the correct skeleton should be exported with umodel_kena.exe.
    ANIMATIONS
        Workflow 1: Faster but doesn't seem to work for Kena, and who knows who else:
            - Extract animations with FModel4
                Workflow: https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7922.msg41369.html#msg41369 : Use FModel4 to output to .psa:
                    Browse game files
                    Doubleclick the 16GB .pak file
                    Press F6
                    Double click stuff
                    Outputs .psa files to path specified in settings.
            - Import with .psk/.psa io addon.
            - Armature should be selected, and it must be an armature that came out of umodel set to .psk, IT WON'T WORK WITH SKELETON FROM GLTF EXPORT! (even with "Guess Bind Pose" disabled on import)
        Workflow 2: Much more painful, but seems necessary for Kena
            - Get ACLViewer custom build for Kena from https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24009&p=178401&hilit=Kena#p178401
            - Extract animations and skeleton to .uasset files with uModel
            - Extract character to GLTF with uModel
            - Convert character to NUX using Noesis, by installing the script from ACLViewer as a Noesis addon.
            - Load the character NUX and skeleton .uasset in ACLViewer
            - One by one, load .uasset animations in ACLViewer and export them as NUX.
            - Batch convert the NUX animations to GLTF with Noesis
            - TODO: Write batch importer for the resulting GLTF's:
                For each file:
                - Import file
                - Delete all selected files
                - Rename an action that has a specific name ("Armature_Default.001" or so) to the filename without "out" at the end.
                - Give it a fake user
                - recursive purge

    STATIC MESHES
    - Extract everything to .uasset files first.
    - A quick python script to scan through the extracted .uassets and delete every folder that has "Animation" in the name. This is because umodel_kena.exe crashes when trying to export animations.
    - Now extract everything from those .uasset files! (With "Don't overwrite existing" enabled)

    - Generate collections with kena_generate_collections.py
    - Import stuff with import_folders() from the same file

    - Clean shit up manually based on Asset Browser previews
        Inorganic DONE! Everything else... TODO.

NOTES
    Assets exclusive to cutscenes NEVER SHIPPED WITH THE GAME, eg. the awesome creature from the game's final cutscene.

- Export everything with umodel_kena.exe (for correct skeleton positions)
    idk if static meshes will work, if not, those will need another pass with regular umodel_64.exe.

        Not sure how this could be automated.

- Import to Blender
- Some script to auto set-up materials based on the umodel-exported Material data.
